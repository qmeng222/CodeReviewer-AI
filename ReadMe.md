# CodeReviewer-AI

## About:

- Purpose: CodeReviewer-AI is an innovative project designed to streamline the process of code review. It utilizes the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to automatically analyze code files, provide detailed feedback, and suggest improvements in terms of style, performance, readability, and maintainability.

- Analysis: The code reviewer works by ingesting code files and analyzing them using advanced natural language processing algorithms. It examines the code structure, syntax, naming conventions, and various programming best practices. Based on this analysis, it generates a comprehensive report with a list of suggestions for enhancing the code quality.

- Feedback: The feedback generated by the GPT Automatic Code Reviewer is presented in an interactive and user-friendly interface. The reviewer provides detailed explanations for each suggestion, helping developers understand the rationale behind the recommended changes. The interface offers options for accepting or rejecting the suggested modifications, empowering developers to make informed decisions.

- Controls & Auto-Save: One of the key features of this project is the ability to preview the suggested changes before making any modifications. This ensures that developers have full control over the codebase and can selectively apply the suggested improvements according to their preferences. Once the changes are accepted, the GPT Automatic Code Reviewer automatically saves the modified code, simplifying the process of integrating the suggested improvements into the codebase.
